# Greenbone Community Edition (GVM) Professional Installation Script for Kali Linux
#
# Description: This script automates the installation and configuration of GVM 
#              on Kali Linux based on the official documentation, with the 
#              following custom configurations:
#              1. Enables remote access to the web UI (from any IP).
#              2. Sets static credentials (admin/admin).
#              3. Enables GVM services to start automatically on boot.
#              4. Opens the default port (9392) in the UFW firewall.

# Author: Gemini
# Version: 2.3 (Explicit PostgreSQL version install)
